```{r Problem 1b}
## The number of observations in the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet is
nrow(trash_wheel)
## The variable dumpster gives a number from 1-285 that identifies which dumpster the data is referencing.
## The variables month, year, and date give information on the date of trash collection by Mr. Trash wheel, which ranges from May 2015 to July 2018.
## The variables weight_tons and volume_cubic_yards give information on how much trash was collected.
```

```{r Problem 1c}
## The number of observations in the combined precipitation dataset is
nrow(precipitation_2017_2018)
## The variable precipitation_inches gives the amount of precipitation in inches.
## The variables month and year give information on the date that precipitation fell in, and ranges from January 2017 to July 2018.
```

```{r Problem 1d}
## The total amount of rainfall in 2018 (for available data) was
precipitation_2017_2018 %>%
  filter(year==2018) %>%
  summarize(total_prec = sum(precipitation_inches))

## The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 was
trash_wheel %>%
  filter(year==2017) %>%
  summarize(median_sports_balls = median(sports_balls))
